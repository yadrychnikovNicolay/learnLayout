	<div class="static">
		static is the default value. An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way. A static element is said to be not positioned and an element with its position set to anything else is said to be positioned. 

		<style>
			.static {
				position :static;
			}
		</style>
	</div>

	<div class="relative1">relative behaves the same as static unless you add some extra properties. </div>

	<div class="relative2">Setting the top, right, bottom, and left properties of a relatively-positioned element will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position. Other content will not be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element. </div>

	<div class="fixed"> A fixed element does not leave a gap in the page where it would normally have been located.

	Mobile browsers have surprisingly shaky support for fixed. Learn more about the situation here. </div>

	<div class="absolute">absolute is the trickiest position value. absolute behaves like fixed except relative to the nearest positioned ancestor instead of relative to the viewport. If an absolutely-positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and still moves along with page scrolling. Remember, a "positioned" element is one whose position is anything except static. </div>

	<div class="relative">
		This element is relatively-positioned. If this element was position: static; its absolutely-positioned child would escape and would be positioned relative to the document body.
